Defining Diagram:
  INPUTS: level 1's options, level 2's options, number 1-8

  PROCESSING:
    initialize variable randomAnswer1
    initialize variable randomAnswer2
    stay on level1 unitl user's input == randomAnswer1

    stay on level2 unitil user's input == randomAnswer2
  
    initialize variable queenRoom set to randomNumber between 1 to 8
    prompt user for pickRoom beween 1 - 8 until pickRoom == randomNumber

  OUTPUTS:
    display success message
      


Solution Algorithm:

crossRiver
  initialize variable randomAnswer1 = a random number 1 - 3
  SWITCH randomAnswer1
    CASE 1: randomAnswer1 = "boat"
    CASE 2: randomAnswer1 = "floaty"
    CASE 3: randomAnswer1 = "tree"
  IF randomAnswer1 == user's input
    add hideLevel class to level1
    remove hideLevel class from level2
  ENDIF
END

findKey
  initialize variable randomAnswer2 = a random number 1 - 3
  SWITCH randomAnswer2
    CASE 1: randomAnswer2 = "tree"
    CASE 2: randomAnswer2 = "mailBox"
    CASE 3: randomAnswer2 = "shed"
  IF randomAnswer2 == user's input
    add hideLevel class to level2
    remove hideLevel class from level3
    invoke eightRooms()
  ENDIF
END

eightRooms
  initialize variable pickRoom = 0
  initialize variable queenRoom = a random number between 1 - 8 
  WHILE pickRoom != queenRoom
    pickRoom = prompt("Please enter a room number between 1 to 8: ")
    pickRoom = Number(pickRoom)
    SWITCH pickroom 
      case 1:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Troll is coming to you!!!!!!!");
				break;
			case 2:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Bear is coming to you!!!!!");
				break;
			case 3:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Owl is STARING at you!!!!!");
				break;
			case 4:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("There is open Lava pit!");
				break;
			case 5:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Raccoon is coming to you!!!!");
				break;
			case 6:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Wolf is coming to you!!!!");
				break;
			case 7:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Snow White is laying there!!!!!");
				break;
			case 8:
				pickRoom == queenRoom ? null : alert("Endless PIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!");
				break;
			default:
				alert("Please enter a valid number!!!!!!!");
  ENDWHILE
  display "Congratulation! You found the Evil Queen!!!!"
END
